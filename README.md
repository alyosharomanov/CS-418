# CS 418 Interactive Computer Graphics
 
## [Warmup 1: Text to PNG](/warmup-1)
This programming assignment’s goal is to making sure you are ready for the non-real-time MPs that follow. It is dramatically easier than other MPs.

## MP 1: Rasterizer and Compositor
In this programming assignment you will implement the key parts of the fixed functionality of a 2020s-era GPU.

You may solve this assignments in any language you wish, and will write a program that takes a text file in and produces a PNG file, like you did for the associated warmup exercise.

This assignment is split into a required part and a menu of optional parts. For full credit, do all of the required part and 50 points of optional parts. Excess optional points carry over to other assignments’ optional parts, so if you do 100 points of optional on this assignment you can skip the optional parts on another assignment altogether. If you end the term with excess optional points, a small percentage of the excess will considered extra credit, as explained on the syllabus.

Reference input and output files are included below; the full set can be downloaded as mp1files.zip. Do not upload these files as part of your submission: the grading server will supply them instead.

## Warmup 2: Warmup: HTML, Javascript, and WebGL
This assignment is really more about making sure you are ready for the WebGL homeworks that follow. It is much more straightforward than other homeworks.

## MP 2: Dancing Logo
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- An animation of the majestic and inspiring University of Illinois logo
- Additional animations selectable using radio buttons
- All animations are 2D (3D will be added in later assignments)

As with the WebGL warmup, you’ll submit an HTML file and any number of js, css, glsl, and json files. No image files are permitted for this assignment. Also submit a file named implemented.txt listing any optional parts you believe you completed.

As with most assignments, this is divided into required and optional parts. For full credit, you need all the required parts of each assignment and an accumulated average of 50 optional points per assignment. Excess optional points at the end of the semester award extra credit at 3% of their raw point value.

## MP 3: Terrain and other Geometry
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- A set of controls to decide what geometry to generate
- A lit rendering of the generated geometry
- As with the WebGL warmup, you’ll submit an HTML file and any number of js, glsl, and json files. No image files are permitted for this assignment. Also submit a file named implemented.txt listing any optional parts you believe you completed.

As with most assignments, this is divided into required and optional parts. For full credit, you need all the required parts of each assignment and an accumulated average of 50 optional points per assignment. Excess optional points at the end of the semester award extra credit at 3% of their raw point value.

## MP 4: Textures and Flight
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- Keyboard response to move the camera
- One or more texture-mapped objects
- As with the WebGL warmup, you’ll submit an HTML file and any number of js, glsl, json, and image files. Also submit a file named implemented.txt listing any optional parts you believe you completed.

As with most assignments, this is divided into required and optional parts. For full credit, you need all the required parts of each assignment and an accumulated average of 50 optional points per assignment. Excess optional points at the end of the semester award extra credit at 3% of their raw point value.

This assignment build off of the terrain assignment; if you didn’t get the required parts of that assignment working you’ll need to return to it and finish it first.

## MP 4.5: Raytracer
This programming assignment created 3D imagery using ray tracing. In most other respects, its logistics are similar to the rasterizer assignment: you code in any language you want and your program reads a text file and produces an image file.

## MP 5: Particle Effects
You will submit one or more webpages. Each has:
- One full-screen canvas
- In which some particle effect occurs
- As with the WebGL warmup, you’ll submit an HTML file and any number of js, glsl, json, and image files. Some optional credit options may ask for additional HTML files. Also submit a file named implemented.txt listing any optional parts you believe you completed.

Because you might have more than one HTML file, we specify exact file names for the HTML files.
