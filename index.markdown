# CS 418: Interactive Computer Graphics

## [Warmup 1: Text to PNG]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/warmup-1)
This programming assignmentâ€™s goal is to making sure you are ready for the non-real-time MPs that follow.

## [MP 1: Rasterizer and Compositor]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-1)
In this programming assignment you will implement the key parts of the fixed functionality of a 2020s-era GPU.

## [Warmup 2: Warmup: HTML, Javascript, and WebGL]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/warmup-2)
This assignment is really more about making sure you are ready for the WebGL homeworks that follow.

## [MP 2: Dancing Logo]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-2)
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- An animation of the majestic and inspiring University of Illinois logo
- Additional animations selectable using radio buttons
- All animations are 2D (3D will be added in later assignments)

## [MP 3: Terrain and other Geometry]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-3)
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- A set of controls to decide what geometry to generate
- A lit rendering of the generated geometry

## [MP 4: Textures and Flight]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-4)
You will submit a webpage that has:
- One canvas
- Keyboard response to move the camera
- One or more texture-mapped objects

## [MP 4.5: Raytracer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-4.5)
This programming assignment created 3D imagery using ray tracing. In most other respects, its logistics are similar to the rasterizer assignment: you code in any language you want and your program reads a text file and produces an image file.

## [MP 5: Particle Effects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/mp-5)
You will submit one or more webpages. Each has:
- One full-screen canvas
- In which some particle effect occurs
